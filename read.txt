#minimaless


#a theme with... nothing.

#thats right! as distractionfree as can be, no channel bar, no server bar, no member bar, no nothing.




#well, how do i move around then??

#simple! ctrl+k
#youre gonna use ctrl+k for everything, thats the only thing you can even do with this theme anyway.
#(you should also use other keybinds to get to the settings for example)
#if youre unsure how to do something, use ctrl+/ to get a list of all keybinds.

#enjoy!

#colors should be changed in the .css file.
